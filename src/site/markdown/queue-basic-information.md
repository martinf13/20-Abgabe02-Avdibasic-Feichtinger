#Queue Exercise

#### About Queue - Basic Informations
> Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. 
> One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). 
> Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.
