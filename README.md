### **Queue Exercise**

In this exercise we have to find 3 mistakes in the StringQueue class and fix them. After that it is required to create
an own class which implements a queue with generics. The Queue Exercise would be implemented in the Intellij IDE and 
with the Github version control.
We are using following Template:
