### **Queue Exercise**

In this exercise we have to find 3 mistakes in the StringQueue class and fix them. After that it is required to create
an own class which implements a queue with generics. At the end 

### Tasklist:

- [x] create a new **git repository**

- [x] configuration of the **README.md**

- [x] ongoing configuration of the **Labreport**

- [] **add src** files from Michael Ulm repository

- [] **search for bugs and fix them**

- [] after fixing the bugs implement a 100% test coverage

- [] create a **new implemention** of the Queue with generics

- [] implement test for the Queue with generics
 
- [] create **Maven Site Documentation**

### **Project Queues:**

This project implements a Queue where the String objects where stored in an Array. StringQueue.java implements the interface IQueue.java. Now we expand our project with a new implementation of a queue where different data types can be stored (realized with java Generics).

### Tasks:

- [x] setup of our **git repository** and added project structure.

- [x] configuration of **pom.xml**

- [x] **bug search and fixing**

      inspection of StringQueue.java, no test needed because of obvious bugs

- [x] testing StringQueue.java with 100% coverage

- [x] **new implemention** of Queue (Generics)

- [X] testing with 100% coverage 

      including JavaDoc  comments

- [ ] Maven Site documentation

- [ ] finishing labreport (ongoing)
